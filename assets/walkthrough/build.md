# Build the output

To transform your PreTeXt source into a final output format, you **build** the project.

Click the  **â–·PreTeXt** button and select `Build default target` from the pop-up menu.

If you want to build a PDF of the output, select `Build another target...` and then select `pdf` from the list of available targets.

(You can also build a project from the command line: open a terminal in the project folder and run the command `pretext build`.)
