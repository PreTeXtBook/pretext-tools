# Create a new project

To create a new PreTeXt project:

1. Open the VS Code Command Palette: Press ``Ctrl+Shift+P`` (Windows, Linux) or ``Cmd+Shift+P`` (macOS) or use the menu `View -> Command Palette...`
2. Type `PreTeXt: New Project` and hit `Enter`.
3. Select the type of project you would like to create from the dropdown menu
4. Select the folder location for the new project.  Note, you cannot create a new project inside a folder that already contains a `project.ptx` manifest.
