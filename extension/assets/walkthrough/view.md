# View the output

After you have build the web target, you can view the output.  

Click the  **â–·PreTeXt** button and select `View full document` from the pop-up menu.  Then select the `web` target from the list of available targets.

This will open a new tab in your browser and display your document (you might need to refresh the page).

Leave this tab open; the next time you build the web target, switch back to the tab and refresh the page to see the changes.
